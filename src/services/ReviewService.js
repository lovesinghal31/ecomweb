/**
 * In a real application, this would be the flow:
 * 
 * 1. Your frontend calls your backend API
 * 2. Your backend service:
 *    a. Fetches reviews from external sources (Amazon, Flipkart, etc.) using their APIs or web scraping
 *    b. Processes these reviews using an AI service (like OpenAI's API)
 *    c. The AI generates summaries, extracts key points, and analyzes sentiment
 *    d. The processed data is stored in your database and returned to the frontend
 * 3. Your frontend displays the AI-processed review data
 * 
 * This approach provides value to users by:
 * - Saving them time reading hundreds of reviews
 * - Highlighting the most important pros and cons
 * - Providing an unbiased overview of product performance
 * - Aggregating data from multiple sources for better decision-making
